# j-macs

My personal emacs config. the one that I like to use when I am using emacs.

checkout [mjhika.nvim](https://github.com/mjhika/mjhika.nvim) my personal Neovim config started from [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

this config is good for Clojure and contains web-mode and go-mode for HTML/CSS and Go. The configs for the other languages is not perfect (for now), but does get you started.
